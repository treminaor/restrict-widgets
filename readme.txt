It gives every widget an extra control fields that lets you control the pages that the widget will appear on. This plugin creates a new “manage_widgets” capability, that allows you to gives access to widgets page to selected WordPress user roles. You can also set which sidebars and widgets will be available to selected users, which widget options will be available and how it will be displayed.
